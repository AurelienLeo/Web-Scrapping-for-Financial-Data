# Web-Scrapping-for-Financial-Data
During my last internship as a portfolio manager assistant I was using Bloomberg on a daily basis and especially watching every economic data release and their impacts on markets.When it came to an end I began to write a code to retrieve easily from the web (investing.com) the economic data calendar and exploit it.

It is my first web scrapping development, and I have found it quite useful. It taught me how to find and extract data points from a web page.

I'd like to thank one of my engineer friends/former colleagues who explained how web scrapping works, he was my inspiration for this project. Thank you Antoine!
